            Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start
            dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in
            green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are
            swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's
            eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus
            Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a
            wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
            Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!

            Harry Potter’s summer has included the worst birthday ever, doomy
            warnings from a house-elf called Dobby, and rescue from the Dursleys
            by his friend Ron Weasley in a magical flying car! Back at Hogwarts
            School of Witchcraft And Wizardry for his second year, Harry hears
            strange whispers echo through empty corridors – and then the attacks
            start. Students are found as though turned to stone … Dobby’s
            sinister predictions seem to be coming true.

            When the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and screeches to a
            halt in front of him, it’s the start of another far from ordinary
            year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter. Sirius Black, escaped
            mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run – and
            they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination
            class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry’s tea
            leaves... But perhaps most terrifying of all are the Dementors
            patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking kiss.

            The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who
            are over seventeen are allowed to enter – but that doesn’t stop
            Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe’en,
            when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find
            his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will
            face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the
            help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it
            through – alive!

            Dark times have come to Hogwarts. After the Dementors’ attack on his
            cousin Dudley, Harry Potter knows that Voldemort will stop at
            nothing to find him. There are many who deny the Dark Lord’s return,
            but Harry is not alone: a secret Order gathers at Grimmauld Place to
            fight against the Dark forces. Harry must allow Professor Snape to
            teach him how to protect himself from Voldemort’s savage assaults on
            his mind. But they are growing stronger by the day and Harry is
            running out of time.

            When Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive one summer night to collect
            Harry Potter, his wand hand is blackened and shrivelled, but he does
            not reveal why. Secrets and suspicion are spreading through the
            wizarding world, and Hogwarts itself is not safe. Harry is convinced
            that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: there is a Death Eater amongst
            them. Harry will need powerful magic and true friends as he explores
            Voldemort’s darkest secrets, and Dumbledore prepares him to face his
            destiny.

            As he climbs into the sidecar of Hagrid’s motorbike and takes to the
            skies, leaving Privet Drive for the last time, Harry Potter knows
            that Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters are not far behind. The
            protective charm that has kept Harry safe until now is broken, but
            he cannot keep hiding. The Dark Lord is breathing fear into
            everything Harry loves, and to stop him Harry will have to find and
            destroy the remaining Horcruxes. The final battle must begin – Harry
            must stand and face his enemy.
